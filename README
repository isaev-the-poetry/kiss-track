// Installation:

touch .ENV 
echo 'MONGODB_URI="mongodb://root:example@localhost:27017/"' > .ENV
npm install

/**
 *  Tracker browser code /src/front
 *  Tracker server code /src/server
 *  Project is just demo, no compiling/packing etc
 * 
 * Optional requirements:
 *  "Make it so that when you click on the link, all events have time to reach the backend before moving to a new page."
 *  -> Sloved with beacon API.
 *  "Make sure that the CORS request does not preflight the OPTIONS request."
 *  -> Achived by making POST request as plain text.
 *  "Write your tracker embed snippet on the page"
 *  -> My client code is small. It's easier to compress it and add it to the page inline, which will reduce the load time.
